                                    It was a somber gloomy night. Fred was lost in the thick woods. It was cold and raining. One could even hear the thunder. Fred exclaimed, “I wonder why did I even come here!” Soon the misery worsened when some chunks of snow had already fallen. He was
                                    exhausted and shivering. Suddenly he heard echoes of footsteps, footsteps from somewhere nearby. Fred thought, “It would be better if I were accompanied by someone.” Soon he started to follow in the footsteps and reached
                                    a lonely remote house. Which was hidden behind the trees.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    “How horrid it is! To be, or not to be, that is the question. It must end with or by me.”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    He started to advance towards the house. <br> The poor chum met a man in a black cloak. He said gruffly, “Hey! could you please help me think I saw a ghost in the backward.” Fred was anxious but it being Hobson’s choice.
                                    Further, if he helped the man in the black cloak, he might accompany Fred.

                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    “Where, I can’t see anything there.” <br> “Oh! Is it so.” The man in the black cloak laughed. <br>
                                    <br> The strange man in the cloak turned with grim. That horrid cloak was empty. The unholy man was the ghost himself!
