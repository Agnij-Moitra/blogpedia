                                    This is an old diary entry that I wrote almost a year ago during the first phase of the lockdown one can easily infer about the ‚ÄúCorona Times‚Äù from it. It goes as follows:

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sunday, April 5th, 2020<br> 7:00 pm<br><br> Dear Diary,<br> We, humanity, are struck by a strange enemy called the Novel Corona Virus aka COVID-19, and the world is brought to its knees by this small virus. It originated
                                    in Wuhan city of the Hubei Province of China and since then it has spread like a wildfire through the length and breadth of the world. To combat this menace many countries have gone into lockdown so that the Virus can
                                    be contained.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Lockdown means to stop all activities except the essential services to promote social distancing. According to medical advice, the virus spreads through droplets which can generally travel from one to two meters, and therefore social distancing is the
                                    only way to break the chain of transmission. If we maintain social distancing and avoid going to markets, then the probability of getting infected reduces. In our country nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 24th,
                                    2020. This meant everyone was expected to stay where ever they were. Offices, Schools, Colleges, Restaurants were shut down for 21 days. All modes of domestic and international transport were suspended except the movement
                                    of essential goods.
                                </p>
                                As I write, it is the fifteenth day of the lockdown and I‚Äôve realized so many important facts. We, who have a family, sufficient money, and a roof over our heads are indeed blessed. We are getting food and medical assistance in time of our need but thousands
                                are badly hit. The dismal picture of thousands of migrant laborers is indeed heart-wrenching as we hear their voice. The plight of the daily wage earner is indeed not difficult to understand as the person is bereft of work
                                and bereft of money. The country is going through a grave economical crisis and is in a catch 22 situation wherein either option seems to be grim.
                                <p>It, therefore, doesn‚Äôt cease to amaze me why people aren‚Äôt adhering to the rules of social distancing, which would help to contain the spread of the Virus. A little self-control will only help to get us healthy tomorrow.
                                    A little discipline will only help us get a better society. Life In Corona Times, therefore, teaches us to stand united and heal the world and nature.
                                </p>
